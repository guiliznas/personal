      </h1>
      <article>
        <p>
          I&apos;m a full-stack developer who has been studying programming
          since 2013 and working professionally in the field since 2017. My
          journey in technology began with a technical course in Computer
          Science at{" "}
          <a href="https://ifc.edu.br/">Federal Institute of Santa Catarina</a>,
          which I completed in 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, I started as an intern at{" "}
          <a href="https://www.philips.com.br/">Philips</a>, where I worked on
          developing the Tasy system using Java, PL-SQL, and HTML5. This
          experience provided me with a solid foundation for my professional
          growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since May 2018, I&apos;ve been working as a full-stack developer at
          AAWZ, where I have experience in developing and supporting web
          platforms and mobile applications, using technologies such as VueJS,
          React Native, Python, and Flask. Currently, I also work in project
          management and technical leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated with a degree in{" "}
          <a href="https://sin.ufsc.br/">Information Systems from UFSC</a> in
          2022, and in 2023 I started a second degree in Software Engineering at
          Uniasselvi, constantly seeking to improve my technical knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a solid foundation in front-end and back-end development, as
          well as experience with databases and programming logic. I work with
          JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML5/CSS3, Vue.js, React Native, and various
          back-end technologies such as Python, Java, and SQL databases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among my academic achievements, I highlight the Gold Medals in OBMEP
          (Brazilian Mathematics Olympiad for Public Schools) in 2011 and 2012,
          as well as honorable mentions between 2014 and 2016, and participation
          in the Scientific Initiation Program between 2011-2012.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, and have extensive
          experience with practices like Code Review and CI/CD. My soft skills
          include technical leadership, project management, effective
          communication, and complex problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m always looking for new challenges and learning opportunities
          in the field of software development.
